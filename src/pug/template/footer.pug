                Bowling Green State University (BGSU) has built their website
                around the Standards of the World Wide Web Consortium's (W3C)
                Hyper Text Markup Language (HTML) 5 and Cascading Style Sheets
                (CSS). The website was built in compliance with the
                accessibility standards established by section 508 of the
                Rehabilitation Act and detailed in section 1194.22 of the Code
                of Federal Regulations, "Web-based intranet and internet
                information and applications"
                (#[+link({href: "https://www.section508.gov/"})]).
            p(class=css.small).
                BGSU utilizes many web masters across campus to maintain all of
                its web properties. Keeping the BGSU website in compliance with
                section 508 is a joint effort between Accessibility Services,
                Marketing and Communications and Information Technology
                Services. If any page is discovered to be inaccessible, please
                report it using the above link and we will ensure that the
                issue is addressed.
